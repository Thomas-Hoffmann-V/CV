									<br>My goal is to find a job where I can build 3D web sites and web apps that provide pixel-perfect, performant experiences and create dynamic blogs at low cost.<br> 
									<br>As well as being able to create and manage databases with impenetrable security.<br>
									<br>I enjoy creating unique projects and I am looking forward to improving the technology I am using to program 3D web sites.

    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> <p>
                  Thomas Hoffmann built the [ (NFF) – (Niños Felices Con Futuro)] app as

                  Thomas Hoffmann at no cost and is intended for use as
                  is.

                  the time and date of your use of the Service, and other
                  statistics.
                </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
                  Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                  commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
                  to your browser from the websites that you visit and are

                  I may employ third-party companies and

                  I want to inform users of this Service
                  that these third parties have access to your Personal
                  Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to

                  of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
                  storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
                  guarantee its absolute security.
                </p> <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p> <p>
                  This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
                  a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
                  that these external sites are not operated by me.

                  services.

                  identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
                  I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                  me with personal information, I immediately
                  delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
                  and you are aware that your child has provided us with
                  personal information, please contact me so that
                  I will be able to do necessary actions.
                </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p>
